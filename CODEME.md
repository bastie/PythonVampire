We provide some information for You.

## Locations ##

### Milestones ###
This project implement what is needed for coding or requested by coders or provided by supporters.
Perhaps, focus on
* core package implementation from Java Card API, Classic Edition
* Java 9+ module system or Java 8 compact profile system
* Java Editions Card, ME, SE, EE

### Documentation ###
Docs are written with markdown syntax for github, pdoc and PyPI. For example *** is not allowed.
But please DO NOT WRITE DOCUMENTATION. Write readable code and hope Java API docs are enough.

### Sources ###
* The target is all under Apache 2.0 license (or BSD-2-clause or Public Domain).
* The target is all programm files are Python source, no shell.
* The target is use primary the Python API, secondary the best-in-class 3rd party OSS and only than self coding to implement Vampire API.

#### Tests ####
We do not write tests to write test. We write test if we make a bugfix. We write simple readable methods an need tests not before we have a problem.
If we repair a bug we write a test. But who have bugs?
